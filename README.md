<h2>I have successfully completed the Hack The Box Pro Labs: APTLabs, an advanced training program designed to simulate real-world Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) scenarios.</h2>
            <p>Through this program, I gained hands-on experience in:</p>
            <pre>
         ✅Active Directory enumeration & exploitation

            ✅Ability to compromise networks without using any CVEs

            ✅Bypassing common security features such as 2FA

            ✅Evading endpoint protections

            ✅Exploiting interactive users

            ✅Lateral movement

            ✅Local privilege escalation

Looking forward to leveraging these advanced skills to tackle complex cybersecurity challenges.
